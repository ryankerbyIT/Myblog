## Section 2: Setting Up Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### What is Azure Container Registry?
Azure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service that provides a secure and scalable way to store and manage container images. It integrates seamlessly with Azure services, including Azure Container Apps, to facilitate the deployment of containerized applications. 

> When creating your ACR, choose the **Premium** tier if you plan to use features like private endpoints or replication to other Azure regions. Otherwise, the **Basic** tier is suitable for small projects and testing.
{:.prompt-tip}

### Creating an Azure Container Registry
To create an ACR, you can use the Azure portal or Azure CLI. Here, we demonstrate the process using the Azure CLI:

1. Open the terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerRegistry --sku Basic
```

Replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of your resource group and `myContainerRegistry` with a unique name for your registry. The `--sku Basic` flag specifies the pricing tier. You can choose between Basic, Standard, and Premium, depending on your needs. 

### Pushing Docker Images to ACR
Once your registry is created, you can push container images to ACR. Hereâ€™s how to build, tag, and push a Docker image to your ACR:

1. ### Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
```
2. ### Tag the Docker image for ACR:
```bash
docker tag myapp:v1 mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:v1
```
3. ### Push the Docker image to ACR:
```bash
docker push mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:v1
```

> Use meaningful tags for your Docker images to track different versions easily. For instance, use `myapp:v1.0`, `myapp:latest`, or even include build numbers.
{:.prompt-tip}

### Security Best Practices for ACR
- Private Link: Enable Azure Private Link to restrict access to the registry, ensuring that only resources within your virtual network can access the registry.
- Managed Identities: Use managed identities to allow Azure Container Apps to securely pull images from ACR without requiring explicit credentials. 

> Managed identities help reduce security risks by avoiding hard-coded credentials in your application code. Make sure to enable it for secure image pulls in production environments.

## Section 3: Deploying Containers with Azure Container Apps

### Setting Up an Azure Container Apps Environment
Before deploying your containerized application, you need to create an environment within Azure Container Apps. This environment acts as a logical grouping for your apps. 

> Environments in Azure Container Apps allow you to isolate different application deployments, enabling better organization and management of your resources.
{:.prompt-info}

1. Create an environment using Azure CLI:
```bash
az containerapp env create --name myEnv --resource-group myResourceGroup --location eastus
```
1. Replace `myEnv` and `myResourceGroup` with the appropriate names.

### Deploying a Containerized Application
Now that the environment is set up, deploy your application using the container image stored in ACR. 

> Always specify a versioned image tag when deploying to avoid unexpected changes in your application behavior due to image updates.
{:.prompt-tip}

1. Use the following command to deploy the application:
```bash
az containerapp create --name myApp --resource-group myResourceGroup --image mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:v1 --environment myEnv
```
1. You can customize the deployment by specifying environment variables, secrets, and application settings using flags in the CLI command.

### Configuring Ingress and Scaling
**Ingress:** Use the ingress feature to control the accessibility of your application. You can expose the application to the public internet or restrict it to internal network access.
**Scaling:** Azure Container Apps supports autoscaling. You can configure autoscaling rules using the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaler (KEDA) to scale based on HTTP traffic, event triggers, or custom metrics.

> Autoscaling with KEDA allows your app to handle varying loads efficiently, and scaling to zero when not in use helps to minimize costs.
{:.prompt-info}

## Section 4: Automating Deployments with Azure Pipelines

### Introduction to Azure Pipelines for CI/CD
Azure Pipelines is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) service provided by Azure DevOps. It allows you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying containerized applications to Azure services. 

### Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline for Azure Container Apps
1. **Create a Pipeline:** Start by creating a new pipeline in Azure DevOps. This pipeline will automate the building of the Docker image, push it to ACR, and deploy the image to Azure Container Apps.
2. **Define Pipeline Stages:** Use a YAML file to define the pipeline stages:
- **Build Stage:** This stage builds the Docker image.
- **Push Stage:** Pushes the image to ACR.
- **Deploy Stage:** Deploys the image to Azure Container Apps.

> Use secrets in your pipeline to handle sensitive information such as registry credentials and access keys. Azure DevOps provides a secure way to store and access these secrets.
{:.prompt-tip}

Sample **YAML** configuration:
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
steps:
  - task: Docker@2
    inputs:
      command: 'buildAndPush'
      repository: '$(ACR_NAME).azurecr.io/myapp'
      dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
      tags: '$(Build.BuildId)'
  - task: AzureCLI@2
    inputs:
      scriptType: 'bash'
      scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
      inlineScript: |
        az containerapp create --name myApp --resource-group myResourceGroup --image $(ACR_NAME).azurecr.io/myapp:$(Build.BuildId) --environment myEnv
```

1. **Integrate ACR with Azure Pipelines:** Configure a service connection in Azure DevOps to securely authenticate with your Azure Container Registry.

### Best Practices for Secure Deployment
- Use secrets and environment variables within the pipeline to handle sensitive information securely.
- Implement approval checks in the pipeline to review changes before deploying to production.  

> Utilize the `Azure Key Vault` to store secrets and retrieve them within your CI/CD pipelines. This approach ensures that sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and connection strings are kept secure and out of the source code.
{:.prompt-tip}

> Azure Pipelines offers built-in support for integration with GitHub, Bitbucket, and other Git repositories, allowing you to automate your container build and deployment process seamlessly.

## Section 5: Managing and Scaling Containerized Apps in Azure

### Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Automatically add container instances based on demand using autoscaling rules.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Allocate more CPU and memory to your container app for better performance. 

> Monitor application metrics to fine-tune your scaling strategy. Over-provisioning can lead to unnecessary costs, while under-provisioning may affect performance. Use `Azure Monitor` to keep track of resource usage and optimize your scaling configurations.
{:.prompt-tip}

### Rolling Updates and Versioning
- Perform rolling updates to minimize downtime during application deployment.
- Implement versioning strategies to manage multiple versions of your application effectively.

> Azure Container Apps supports zero-downtime deployments by using revisions. Each time you deploy a new version of your application, Azure creates a new revision and gradually shifts traffic to the new deployment. You can also manually split traffic between different revisions to test new versions safely.
{:.prompt-info}

### Monitoring, Alerts, and Diagnostics
- Set up Azure Monitor and Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring of application health.
- Create alerts to notify your team of unusual activity, such as high CPU usage or HTTP errors.

> Use Azure Monitorâ€™s alerting capabilities to automate incident response processes, ensuring that potential issues are addressed promptly. You can configure alerts to send notifications via email, SMS, or integrate with IT service management tools like ServiceNow.
{:.prompt-info}

> For more granular monitoring, consider enabling distributed tracing in your application using `Application Insights`. This practice provides detailed insights into request latencies and helps identify bottlenecks within microservices.
{:.prompt-tip}

---

### Secure and Reliable Operations
- Configure network security using virtual networks and private endpoints to restrict access to your container apps.
- Enable SSL/TLS to secure communications with your applications.
- Regularly update container images to address vulnerabilities and ensure compliance.

> Never include sensitive information (e.g., credentials, tokens) in your container images or application code. Instead, use environment variables and Azure Key Vault for secure storage and access to secrets.
{:.prompt-warning}

> Use `Azure Policy` to enforce organizational standards and ensure compliance for your containerized applications. For example, you can restrict the use of certain container images or enforce SSL/TLS encryption.
{:.prompt-tip}
